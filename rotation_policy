Establishing a robust key rotation process is vital for maintaining the security and integrity of your systems. As a senior architect, here are the recommended steps and considerations for designing and implementing a key rotation process, especially for systems utilizing RSA and AES algorithms for encryption and signing in client-based sessions:

1. Planning and Policy Development
Define Key Lifecycle: Establish policies for key generation, usage, rotation, and retirement. This includes determining the lifespan of keys based on risk assessment and compliance requirements.
Rotation Frequency: Decide on how often keys should be rotated, considering the balance between security and operational feasibility. For RSA keys used in digital signatures and encryption, a longer lifecycle is common, whereas AES keys, due to their usage in symmetric encryption, might be rotated more frequently.
2. System Preparation
Support for Dual Keys: Ensure the system can support having multiple active keys (old and new) simultaneously. This is crucial for a seamless transition and minimizing downtime.
Automate Processes: Where possible, automate the generation, deployment, and revocation of keys. Automation reduces human error and operational overhead.
3. Implementation of Key Rotation
Generate New Keys: Securely generate new keys, adhering to best practices for key strength and algorithm compatibility.
Deploy New Keys: Introduce the new keys into your system, configuring them for use alongside the old keys. This step may involve updating configuration files, key stores, or databases.
Update Applications: Ensure that all applications, services, and components that utilize these keys are updated to recognize and use the new keys. This might involve deploying updated configurations or code changes.
Monitor: Closely monitor the system for any issues arising from the key rotation, ready to address any problems without affecting system availability.
4. Transition Period
Parallel Operation: Allow a transition period where both old and new keys are operational. This ensures uninterrupted service and provides time for any external systems to update their configurations if necessary.
Communication: Inform all stakeholders of the key rotation schedule and any required actions on their part.
5. Retirement of Old Keys
Revoke Old Keys: After a sufficient transition period, revoke the old keys, ensuring they can no longer be used for encryption, decryption, or signing.
Secure Deletion: Securely delete the old keys from all systems and backups to prevent unauthorized use.
6. Documentation and Audit
Record-Keeping: Document the entire key rotation process, including dates of rotation, key identifiers, and system components affected.
Audit: Regularly audit the key management process for compliance with policies and external regulations. This includes reviewing the effectiveness of the rotation process and making improvements as necessary.
7. Review and Continual Improvement
Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop to identify issues, gather lessons learned, and improve the key rotation process over time.
Regular Reviews: Periodically review and update the key rotation policy and procedures to adapt to new threats, technology changes, and regulatory requirements.
By following these steps, you can ensure that your key rotation process is secure, efficient, and aligned with best practices, thereby protecting your systems and data from potential security threats.
